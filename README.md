3) Using our last 2 remaining late days.
We would like to apologize ahead of time. Tears were shed, computers were (almost) thrown.



  Option 6 - Given faculty ID, print all names and information of advisees does not work correctly. No output to terminal and will keep prompting user for input.
  Option 10 - Delete faculty member given ID. Does not work, will not delete the faculty member.
  Option 11 - Does not change students advisor.
  Option 12 - Will not remove advisee from faculty members list.

  Reading files - Does not work 100% correctly.
